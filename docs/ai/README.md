# Ordivon AI Onboarding

> **Last updated**: Phase DG-Z (2026-04-30)
> **Active phase**: Phase 7P — CLOSED | DG-Z — ACTIVE (Document Governance Pack Stage Summit)

For any AI agent (ChatGPT, Claude, Codex, Copilot, IDE assistant) working in this repository.

## Quick Start

Read these in order on first visit:

1. **ordivon-root-context.md** — what Ordivon is (and is not)
2. **architecture-file-map.md** — where things live
3. **current-phase-boundaries.md** — what's active, what's deferred, what's NO-GO
4. **agent-output-contract.md** — required output shape for every AI task receipt
5. **agent-working-rules.md** — how to operate within Ordivon governance
6. **task-prompt-template.md** — template for compressed phase prompts

If you're a human reading this: these docs are the AI-facing root context pack. They
replace the need to paste 3000-word briefs into every prompt. A compressed phase
prompt + these docs should suffice for most tasks.
