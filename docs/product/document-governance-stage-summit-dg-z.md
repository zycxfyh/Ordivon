# Document Governance Pack — Stage Summit (DG-Z Close)

Status: **PUBLISHED** | Date: 2026-04-30 | Phase: DG-Z (sealed by DG-Z-S2 closure consistency + final assessment)
Tags: `governance`, `dg-pack`, `stage-summit`, `closure`, `meta-verification`

## 1. Executive Summary

The Document Governance Pack (DG-1 through DG-6D-S) is **closed** as a
foundational governance stage. It created Ordivon's system-memory,
document-authority, verification-integrity, and anti-self-deception
governance layer.

**DG Pack was NOT**: documentation cleanup, a wiki project, a knowledge
management exercise.

**DG Pack WAS**: the systematic hardening of Ordivon's ability to remember,
verify, challenge, and govern its own knowledge state — documents,
receipts, ledgers, checkers, baselines, debts, and AI context.

**DG Pack does NOT authorize**: Phase 8, live trading, broker write,
auto trading, Policy activation, or RiskEngine enforcement.

## 2. Phase Timeline — 18 Sub-Phases

## 4. What Was Proved

1. **Documents can be governed as first-class system objects** — type, status,
   authority, freshness, lifecycle, archive rules all machine-checked.

2. **Current truth vs evidence vs archive can be machine-distinguished** —
   document-registry.jsonl with authority levels, enforced by checker.

3. **Stale root context can be detected and prevented** — DG-3 found and fixed
   ordvivon-root-context.md (Phase 6 ACTIVE → Phase 7P CLOSED). DG-4 added
   freshness/staleness automation with last_verified + stale_after_days.

4. **Dangerous semantic phrases can be blocked** — 6 phrase patterns checked
   across 20 current markdown files. "Phase 8 active", "live trading active",
   "CandidateRule is Policy", "ledger authorizes" — zero unsafe occurrences.

5. **Verification debt can be tracked** — 3-entry debt ledger, 16 tests,
   overdue detection, deterministic date injection.

6. **Receipts can be checked for self-contradiction** — 7 hard-fail patterns:
   Skipped None + not run, SEALED + pending, clean working tree + untracked,
   stale baseline count, Ruff clean overclaim, CandidateRule validated.

7. **Baseline hard gates can be protected by manifest** — 11-gate manifest
   cross-checked against run_verification_baseline.py. Gate removal, downgrade,
   and no-op detection enforced.

8. **Core/Pack/Adapter/Governance Plane ontology can be registered and
   checked** — `docs/architecture/ordivon-core-pack-adapter-ontology.md`
   registered as source_of_truth with structural_layers and governance_planes
   metadata.

9. **pr-fast can include document/meta-governance gates** — baseline grew from
   7/7 (pre-DG) to 11/11 (post DG-6C): document registry, verification debt,
   receipt integrity, gate manifest.

10. **Tooling residue can be triaged** — VD-002 (.coveragerc) and VD-003
    (.pre-commit-config.yaml) deleted as accidental residue, debts closed.

## 5. What Was NOT Proved

1. **Live trading readiness** — Not tested, not attempted. Phase 8 DEFERRED.
2. **Phase 8 readiness** — 3/10 criteria met. Insufficient paper round trips.
3. **Active Policy enforcement** — remains NO-GO per Phase 5 closure.
4. **Rust kernel extraction** — Core invariants documented but not extracted.
5. **Full wiki/Obsidian/knowledge harness implementation** — wiki-index.md is
   a prototype; full surface deferred.
6. **Whole-repo documentation registration** — 30 critical docs registered;
    ~30+ docs remain unregistered (design/, runbooks/, ADRs, etc.).
7. **Full global ruff cleanup** — 4 F401 in Phase 5/H-era tests remain
   (classified out-of-scope, non-blocking).
8. **Guarantee against future semantic mistakes** — checkers validate current
   state; future AI can still write dangerous phrases if checkers aren't
   maintained.

## 5a. Known Test Instability — VD-2026-04-30-004 (CLOSED)

**Fixed in Post-DG-H1.** The root cause was a shallow `dict()` copy on
`VALID_MANIFEST` in three negative tests, causing shared gate dict mutation
between test runs. Fixed by using `copy.deepcopy()`. Subprocess approach
was also replaced with direct function calls (`extract_baseline_gates` +
`check_invariants`) for speed and determinism. Tests are now deterministic:
192 passed, 0 xfail/xpass across 10 consecutive full-governance runs.
VD-004 closed.

## 6. Open Debt and Exceptions

| ID | Category | Severity | Status | Notes |
|----|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| VD-2026-04-30-001 | pre_existing_tooling_debt | low | **closed** | AGENTS.md ruff markdown preview. Closed by reclassification in Post-DG-H2. Failure was tool_limitation + command_mismatch, not file defect. AGENTS.md unchanged. |
| VD-2026-04-30-002 | untracked_residue | medium | **closed** | .coveragerc deleted in DG-6D |
| VD-2026-04-30-003 | untracked_residue | medium | **closed** | .pre-commit-config.yaml deleted in DG-6D |
| VD-2026-04-30-004 | pre_existing_tooling_debt | medium | **closed** | Manifest test xfail/xpass instability. Fixed in Post-DG-H1 (shallow copy bug). Tests now deterministic: 192 passed, 0 xfail/xpass. |

**Non-DG observed ruff noise**: 4 F401 unused imports in
`test_audit_strictification.py`, `test_h5_finance_governance_hard_gate.py`,
`test_h9c2_escalate_coverage.py`. Phase 5/H-era files, cosmetic only.
Classified out-of-scope for DG-Z. Not hidden. Not registered as DG debt.
Not a DG-Z blocker.

**No untracked residue remains** after DG-6D — working tree is clean.

## 7. NO-GO Boundary Confirmation

| Boundary | Status | Since |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Phase 8 | **DEFERRED** (3/10) | Phase 7P Stage Summit |
| Live trading | **NO-GO** | Phase 7P Stage Summit |
| Broker write | **NO-GO** | Design-time |
| Auto trading | **NO-GO** | Permanently disabled |
| Policy activation | **NO-GO** | Phase 5 closure |
| RiskEngine active enforcement | **NO-GO** | Phase 5 closure |
| CandidateRules → Policy | **NO-GO** | Governance doctrine §3.6 |
| JSONL ledgers | **evidence only** | Phase 7P-D1 |
| Wiki / Knowledge Harness | **navigation only, not source of truth** | DG-6 |
| Obsidian | **external Knowledge Harness, not Ordivon identity** | DG-6A |

## 8. Governance Philosophy

DG Pack is not "documentation cleanup." It is Ordivon's **system-memory
and anti-self-deception governance layer.**

Core principles established:

- **Debt may exist, but hidden debt may not become truth.**
- **Unverified work may exist, but it must not be called sealed.**
- **Checkers validate consistency/honesty; they do not authorize action.**
- **A baseline cannot be trusted if its own gates can be silently weakened.**
- **Receipts must not claim what the evidence does not support.**

These are now enforced by 11 hard gates in pr-fast. Every phase that follows
DG Pack inherits this meta-verification layer.

## 9. New AI Context Check

A fresh AI reading root docs + this Stage Summit would understand:

- Phase 7P is CLOSED — Alpaca Paper Dogfood proved governance pipeline integrity
- DG Pack is CLOSED — system memory and meta-verification layer established
- pr-fast is 11/11 — document governance, debt tracking, receipt integrity,
  gate manifest are all hard gates
- Phase 8 remains DEFERRED — 3/10 criteria
- Live trading, broker write, auto trading, Policy activation remain NO-GO
- CandidateRules remain advisory — NOT Policy
- JSONL ledgers are evidence, not execution authority
- Wiki/Obsidian are navigation/harness layers, not source of truth
- 0 open debts (VD-001 through VD-004 all closed in Post-DG-H1/H2)
- 4 non-DG F401 ruff issues are cosmetic, out-of-scope for DG

## 10. Next Recommended Phase

Phase 8 is **NOT** automatically next. The following are recommended:

**Priority 1 — Knowledge Navigation / Wiki Extension (low risk)**:
Build on DG-6's wiki-index.md prototype. Extend registry-derived navigation.
Keep "navigation, not source of truth" boundary.

**Priority 2 — Global Tooling Hygiene (low risk)**:
4 non-DG F401 ruff issues cleaned in Post-DG-H3. Zero F401 remaining in governance tests.
Standardize ruff configuration across the repo.

**Priority 3 — Rust Kernel Scoping (planning only)**:
Identify Core invariants for extraction. No implementation until scoped
and approved.

**Phase 8 remains gated by**: ≥5 paper round trips (currently 3), live
broker selected, $100 funded, live boundary docs, human Stage Summit.

## 11. Non-Activation Clause

This Stage Summit closes DG Pack. It does not open any new phase, authorize
any trading action, activate any Policy, or modify any RiskEngine rule.
All NO-GO boundaries established by Phase 5, Phase 7P Stage Summit, and
DG Pack governance remain in full effect.

## 12. Final Assessment — Foundation Closed, Program Continues

### 12.1 What DG Pack Is (and Is Not)

DG Pack is not documentation cleanup. It is Ordivon's **system-memory
and anti-self-deception infrastructure.**

It upgraded Ordivon from "has documents" to "has verifiable system memory",
from "has receipts" to "receipts are audited for honesty", from "has a
baseline" to "the baseline cannot be silently weakened."

### 12.2 Five-Layer Defense Architecture

DG Pack established five defense layers, each with machine-checked controls:

| Layer | Name | Controls |
|-------|------|----------|
| L1 | System Memory | AGENTS.md, docs/ai, document-registry.jsonl, Stage Summit |
| L2 | Semantic Safety | Dangerous phrase checker, ontology registry, CandidateRule≠Policy, Paper≠Live, Ledger≠Authority |
| L3 | Verification Honesty | Verification debt ledger, receipt integrity checker |
| L4 | Baseline Integrity | Verification gate manifest, pr-fast 11/11 |
| L5 | AI Handoff | Agent output contract, New AI Context Check, root context sync |

### 12.3 Foundation Closed, Program Continues

**DG Pack foundation stage is CLOSED.**
**Document governance as a program continues.**

This stage established the infrastructure. Future program work includes:
full-repo documentation registration, knowledge graph maturity,
Wiki/Obsidian harness compatibility, global tooling hygiene, Rust kernel
extraction, and cross-Pack unified dashboard.

DG-Z closure does NOT mean document governance work is finished forever.
It means the foundation is stable enough to support the next layer of work.

### 12.4 Residual Risks

Four risks that DG Pack cannot eliminate but must declare:

1. **DG Pack self-expansion**: The pack must not absorb all future
   knowledge work. Domain semantics belong to Finance/Policy/Design Packs.
   External tools belong to Adapter/Harness. Display belongs to Surface.

2. **Checker maintenance burden**: 11/11 is strong today. Each new checker
   adds maintenance cost. Future phases should review checker quality
   (false positives, form-over-substance responses, baseline slowdown).

3. **Stage Summit as victory narrative**: Stage Summits must remain
   postmortem-style factual artifacts, not success stories. The receipt
   integrity checker enforces this mechanically; the culture must enforce
   it editorially.

4. **Out-of-scope abuse**: "Out-of-scope for current phase" is valid
   triage. It must never become "not our problem." Rules: (a) out-of-scope
   does not block current phase, (b) out-of-scope is not hidden,
   (c) repeated out-of-scope items must enter global tooling hygiene
   backlog.

### 12.5 Postmortem-Style Commitment

This Stage Summit is written as a factual artifact, not a victory
declaration. Debts are listed. Instabilities are registered. What was
not proved is stated at equal weight to what was proved. Future Stage
Summits must maintain this standard.

### 12.6 Bilingual Semantic Precision

Ordivon's key terms carry governance weight in both Chinese and English.
The ontology registry (`CandidateRule`, `Policy`, `Paper`, `Live`,
`Ledger`, `Receipt`, `Authority`, `Evidence`) constrains how these terms
may be used. Future glossary work should extend this constraint to a
formal bilingual governance glossary, ensuring precision is maintained
across Chinese philosophical reasoning and English technical execution.

### 12.7 VD-001: Verification Signal Classification in Practice

The VD-001 debt (AGENTS.md ruff markdown formatting) taught a second-order
governance lesson: **not all checker failures indicate object defects.**

VD-001 initially appeared as a formatting debt. Investigation proved
AGENTS.md had zero formatting issues — the failure was ruff's stable-mode
refusal to process Markdown without `--preview`. The checker was measuring
a tool feature gate, not a file defect.

This led to a formalization in `verification-debt-policy.md` (§8):
- Eight failure classes: object_defect, tool_limitation, command_mismatch,
  environment_mismatch, spec_mismatch, historical_noise, misclassification,
  expected_negative_control
- Five closure reasons beyond "fixed": closed_by_reclassification,
  closed_as_tool_limitation, closed_as_out_of_scope, fixed_by_command_correction,
  superseded_by_tool_update
- Core rule: do not mutate authoritative documents to satisfy a
  misclassified checker

VD-001 was closed by reclassification. This is now a documented,
repeatable governance pattern — not an exception.

**The meta-lesson**: Ordivon must govern not only what checkers check,
but how checker results are interpreted. A failed verification command
is an observation, not a verdict.

## 13. Closure Predicate

DG Pack foundation stage is formally CLOSED when all of these hold:

1. DG-Z Stage Summit exists — ✅
2. Root context says DG Pack CLOSED, not ACTIVE/CLOSING — ✅
3. pr-fast is 11/11 — ✅
4. Document registry checker passes — ✅
5. Verification debt checker passes — ✅
6. Receipt integrity checker passes — ✅
7. Gate manifest checker passes — ✅
8. All registered verification debt is closed with classified closure reasons — ✅ (VD-001 through VD-004, all closed in Post-DG-H1/H2)
9. Verification debt policy includes signal classification framework — ✅ (policy §8)
10. Phase 8 remains DEFERRED; all live/auto/Policy NO-GO intact — ✅

**Verdict: DG Pack foundation stage — CLOSED. Registered verification debt: zero. Signal classification framework active.**
