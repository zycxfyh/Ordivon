# Document Governance Pack — Stage Summit (DG-Z Close)

Status: **PUBLISHED** | Date: 2026-04-30 | Phase: DG-Z
Tags: `governance`, `dg-pack`, `stage-summit`, `closure`, `meta-verification`

## 1. Executive Summary

The Document Governance Pack (DG-1 through DG-6D-S) is **closed** as a
foundational governance stage. It created Ordivon's system-memory,
document-authority, verification-integrity, and anti-self-deception
governance layer.

**DG Pack was NOT**: documentation cleanup, a wiki project, a knowledge
management exercise.

**DG Pack WAS**: the systematic hardening of Ordivon's ability to remember,
verify, challenge, and govern its own knowledge state — documents,
receipts, ledgers, checkers, baselines, debts, and AI context.

**DG Pack does NOT authorize**: Phase 8, live trading, broker write,
auto trading, Policy activation, or RiskEngine enforcement.

## 2. Phase Timeline — 18 Sub-Phases

## 4. What Was Proved

1. **Documents can be governed as first-class system objects** — type, status,
   authority, freshness, lifecycle, archive rules all machine-checked.

2. **Current truth vs evidence vs archive can be machine-distinguished** —
   document-registry.jsonl with authority levels, enforced by checker.

3. **Stale root context can be detected and prevented** — DG-3 found and fixed
   ordvivon-root-context.md (Phase 6 ACTIVE → Phase 7P CLOSED). DG-4 added
   freshness/staleness automation with last_verified + stale_after_days.

4. **Dangerous semantic phrases can be blocked** — 6 phrase patterns checked
   across 20 current markdown files. "Phase 8 active", "live trading active",
   "CandidateRule is Policy", "ledger authorizes" — zero unsafe occurrences.

5. **Verification debt can be tracked** — 3-entry debt ledger, 16 tests,
   overdue detection, deterministic date injection.

6. **Receipts can be checked for self-contradiction** — 7 hard-fail patterns:
   Skipped None + not run, SEALED + pending, clean working tree + untracked,
   stale baseline count, Ruff clean overclaim, CandidateRule validated.

7. **Baseline hard gates can be protected by manifest** — 11-gate manifest
   cross-checked against run_verification_baseline.py. Gate removal, downgrade,
   and no-op detection enforced.

8. **Core/Pack/Adapter/Governance Plane ontology can be registered and
   checked** — `docs/architecture/ordivon-core-pack-adapter-ontology.md`
   registered as source_of_truth with structural_layers and governance_planes
   metadata.

9. **pr-fast can include document/meta-governance gates** — baseline grew from
   7/7 (pre-DG) to 11/11 (post DG-6C): document registry, verification debt,
   receipt integrity, gate manifest.

10. **Tooling residue can be triaged** — VD-002 (.coveragerc) and VD-003
    (.pre-commit-config.yaml) deleted as accidental residue, debts closed.

## 5. What Was NOT Proved

1. **Live trading readiness** — Not tested, not attempted. Phase 8 DEFERRED.
2. **Phase 8 readiness** — 3/10 criteria met. Insufficient paper round trips.
3. **Active Policy enforcement** — remains NO-GO per Phase 5 closure.
4. **Rust kernel extraction** — Core invariants documented but not extracted.
5. **Full wiki/Obsidian/knowledge harness implementation** — wiki-index.md is
   a prototype; full surface deferred.
6. **Whole-repo documentation registration** — 29 critical docs registered;
   ~30+ docs remain unregistered (design/, runbooks/, ADRs, etc.).
7. **Full global ruff cleanup** — 4 F401 in Phase 5/H-era tests remain
   (classified out-of-scope, non-blocking).
8. **Guarantee against future semantic mistakes** — checkers validate current
   state; future AI can still write dangerous phrases if checkers aren't
   maintained.

## 6. Open Debt and Exceptions

| ID | Category | Severity | Status | Notes |
|----|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| VD-2026-04-30-001 | pre_existing_tooling_debt | low | open | AGENTS.md ruff markdown preview. Non-blocking. Expires before DG-Z — now overdue but severity is low, no governance impact. |
| VD-2026-04-30-002 | untracked_residue | medium | **closed** | .coveragerc deleted in DG-6D |
| VD-2026-04-30-003 | untracked_residue | medium | **closed** | .pre-commit-config.yaml deleted in DG-6D |

**Non-DG observed ruff noise**: 4 F401 unused imports in
`test_audit_strictification.py`, `test_h5_finance_governance_hard_gate.py`,
`test_h9c2_escalate_coverage.py`. Phase 5/H-era files, cosmetic only.
Classified out-of-scope for DG-Z. Not hidden. Not registered as DG debt.
Not a DG-Z blocker.

**No untracked residue remains** after DG-6D — working tree is clean.

## 7. NO-GO Boundary Confirmation

| Boundary | Status | Since |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Phase 8 | **DEFERRED** (3/10) | Phase 7P Stage Summit |
| Live trading | **NO-GO** | Phase 7P Stage Summit |
| Broker write | **NO-GO** | Design-time |
| Auto trading | **NO-GO** | Permanently disabled |
| Policy activation | **NO-GO** | Phase 5 closure |
| RiskEngine active enforcement | **NO-GO** | Phase 5 closure |
| CandidateRules → Policy | **NO-GO** | Governance doctrine §3.6 |
| JSONL ledgers | **evidence only** | Phase 7P-D1 |
| Wiki / Knowledge Harness | **navigation only, not source of truth** | DG-6 |
| Obsidian | **external Knowledge Harness, not Ordivon identity** | DG-6A |

## 8. Governance Philosophy

DG Pack is not "documentation cleanup." It is Ordivon's **system-memory
and anti-self-deception governance layer.**

Core principles established:

- **Debt may exist, but hidden debt may not become truth.**
- **Unverified work may exist, but it must not be called sealed.**
- **Checkers validate consistency/honesty; they do not authorize action.**
- **A baseline cannot be trusted if its own gates can be silently weakened.**
- **Receipts must not claim what the evidence does not support.**

These are now enforced by 11 hard gates in pr-fast. Every phase that follows
DG Pack inherits this meta-verification layer.

## 9. New AI Context Check

A fresh AI reading root docs + this Stage Summit would understand:

- Phase 7P is CLOSED — Alpaca Paper Dogfood proved governance pipeline integrity
- DG Pack is CLOSED — system memory and meta-verification layer established
- pr-fast is 11/11 — document governance, debt tracking, receipt integrity,
  gate manifest are all hard gates
- Phase 8 remains DEFERRED — 3/10 criteria
- Live trading, broker write, auto trading, Policy activation remain NO-GO
- CandidateRules remain advisory — NOT Policy
- JSONL ledgers are evidence, not execution authority
- Wiki/Obsidian are navigation/harness layers, not source of truth
- 1 open debt (VD-001, low severity), 2 closed debts (VD-002/003)
- 4 non-DG F401 ruff issues are cosmetic, out-of-scope for DG

## 10. Next Recommended Phase

Phase 8 is **NOT** automatically next. The following are recommended:

**Priority 1 — Knowledge Navigation / Wiki Extension (low risk)**:
Build on DG-6's wiki-index.md prototype. Extend registry-derived navigation.
Keep "navigation, not source of truth" boundary.

**Priority 2 — Global Tooling Hygiene (low risk)**:
Fix VD-001 (AGENTS.md markdown) and 4 non-DG F401 ruff issues.
Standardize ruff configuration across the repo.

**Priority 3 — Rust Kernel Scoping (planning only)**:
Identify Core invariants for extraction. No implementation until scoped
and approved.

**Phase 8 remains gated by**: ≥5 paper round trips (currently 3), live
broker selected, $100 funded, live boundary docs, human Stage Summit.

## 11. Non-Activation Clause

This Stage Summit closes DG Pack. It does not open any new phase, authorize
any trading action, activate any Policy, or modify any RiskEngine rule.
All NO-GO boundaries established by Phase 5, Phase 7P Stage Summit, and
DG Pack governance remain in full effect.
