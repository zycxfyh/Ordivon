# Finance Live Micro-Capital Constitution

Status: **DOCUMENTED** (Phase 7A)
Date: 2026-04-29
Phase: 7A
Tags: `finance`, `constitution`, `micro-capital`, `manual`, `dogfood`, `live`

## 1. Purpose

This constitution governs Ordivon's first manual live finance dogfood.
It is a **$100 micro-capital experiment** designed to test:

- Trading discipline under real market pressure
- Governance workflow completeness (intake → receipt → outcome → review)
- Evidence quality and freshness in live observation
- Human decision quality with Ordivon governance support
- CandidateRule generation from real trading experience

It is **not** a profit-maximization experiment. A financial loss that follows
this constitution is acceptable. A financial loss without governance is not.

## 2. Capital

| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|
| Initial capital | **$100.00 USD** (or equivalent) |
| Max total loss | **$50.00 USD** (hard stop — dogfood ends) |
| Additional capital | **FORBIDDEN** without new Stage Review |
| Profit reinvestment | Allowed within the same phase |
| Account type | Cash only — no margin |

## 3. Execution Model

### 3.1 Manual Execution Only

All trades are placed **manually by a human** outside Ordivon.
Ordivon does not place orders. Ordivon provides:

| Ordivon Provides | Human Does |
|-----------------|------------|
| Pre-trade intake form | Reads intake and decides |
| Risk budget check | Chooses execution venue |
| Market data freshness check | Places manual order |
| Plan receipt (governance decision) | Records actual fill |
| Outcome capture form | Enters outcome data |
| Post-trade review queue | Conducts self-review |
| CandidateRule extraction | Reviews candidate lessons |

### 3.2 Forbidden Execution

| Action | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Broker API order placement | ❌ NO-GO |
| Order cancellation via Ordivon | ❌ NO-GO |
| Order modification via Ordivon | ❌ NO-GO |
| Automated / algorithmic trading | ❌ NO-GO |
| Copy-trading / signal-following | ❌ NO-GO |
| Trading while outcome from prior trade is missing | ❌ NO-GO |

### 3.3 Observation Only

Alpaca Paper Trading remains the **observation and paper reference** only.
Live brokerage selection for actual execution is a separate Phase 7 decision
(Futu or Interactive Brokers — see `docs/runtime/finance-observation-provider-plan.md`).

The observation layer may continue to read Alpaca Paper data for market
reference, but paper fills are not real and must not be used for outcome
capture.

| Excluded | Options, futures, forex, crypto, ETFs, leveraged products, penny stocks |

## 5. Risk Rules

| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|

| Max daily loss | **$15.00 USD (15% of capital)** |
| Max weekly loss | **$25.00 USD (25% of capital)** |
| Loss-streak stop | **3 consecutive losing trades → stop for 24 hours** |
| Cooldown after loss | Minimum 1 hour between trades after a loss |
| Max trades per day | 3 |
| Max trades per week | 10 |

## 13. Phase 7B Readiness Criteria

Phase 7B may begin when:

- [ ] This constitution has been reviewed by a human
- [ ] A live brokerage account exists (Futu or IB)
- [ ] The account is funded with $100 (or equivalent)
- [ ] The operator has placed at least one manual trade before (any venue)
- [ ] Alpaca Paper observation is confirmed working
- [ ] Intake / receipt / outcome / review templates are ready
- [ ] No outstanding Phase 6 issues

Phase 7B is **not** automatic. It requires explicit human declaration.
