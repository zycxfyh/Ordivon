# Document Registry Schema

Status: **ACCEPTED** | Date: 2026-04-30 | Phase: DG-1
Tags: `governance`, `document`, `registry`, `schema`, `manifest`

## 1. Purpose

The Document Registry is a future manifest that links every governed document
to its metadata: type, status, authority, freshness, relationships.

This schema defines the manifest format. **Implemented** in DG-2:
`docs/governance/document-registry.jsonl` (17 entries) with checker at
`scripts/check_document_registry.py`.

**Status note**: The status `accepted` is a valid alias for `current` — a document
that has passed stakeholder acceptance is `accepted` (maps to `current`). Both
are recognized by the checker.

## 2. Registry Entry Schema

Each entry is one JSONL line:

```json
{
  "doc_id": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "path": "string",
  "doc_type": "string",
  "status": "string",
  "authority": "string",
  "phase": "string|null",
  "owner": "string|null",
  "date_created": "ISO8601",
  "date_modified": "ISO8601",
  "last_verified": "ISO8601|null",
  "staleness_days_max": "int|null",
  "supersedes": "string|null",
  "superseded_by": "string|null",
  "ai_read_priority": "int|null",
  "related_ledgers": ["string"],
  "related_receipts": ["string"],
  "related_tests": ["string"],
  "tags": ["string"],
  "notes": "string|null"
}
```

## 3. Field Definitions

| `related_receipts` | [string] | No | Linked receipt paths |
| `related_tests` | [string] | No | Linked test file paths |
| `structural_layers` | [string]\|null | No | Ordivon structural layers: core, pack, adapter, surface, checker, ledger, registry, governance_plane, knowledge_harness, external_harness |
| `governance_planes` | [string]\|null | No | Ordivon governance planes: evidence_state, authority_policy, verification_safety, orchestration_lifecycle, knowledge_documentation, risk_side_effect, actor_trust, surface_representation |
| `tags` | [string] | No | Search/discovery tags |
| `notes` | string\|null | No | Any additional context |

## 4. Registry Validation Rules

A future registry checker should validate:

1. Every `doc_id` is unique
2. Every `path` exists in the filesystem
3. Every `doc_type` is a valid taxonomy type
4. Every `status` is a valid lifecycle status
5. Every `authority` is a valid authority level
6. No document with `status=current` has `last_verified` older than `staleness_days_max`
7. Every `supersedes`/`superseded_by` reference resolves to an existing `doc_id`
8. No `root_context` or `phase_boundary` document has `status=stale`
9. No `receipt`-type document has `superseded_by` set
10. No `ledger`-type document has `live_order=true`

## 6. Registry Storage (Deferred)

Options for registry storage:
- **JSONL file** (simplest): `docs/governance/document-registry.jsonl`
- **DB-backed** (future): SQLite or PostgreSQL with document metadata
- **Git-tracked** (recommended for DG-1 follow-up): JSONL in repo, versioned
- **Wiki-backed** (when wiki exists): wiki pages generate from registry + docs

For DG-1, no storage is implemented. The schema is a design artifact.

## 7. Non-Goals for DG-1

- Registry implementation (JSONL file, DB, or wiki)
- Registry validation checker
- Automated registry population
- Registry integration with CI
- Registry integration with wiki

DG-1 defines the schema. Implementation is deferred.
